# Build Fix Instructions

## The Problem

The errors you're seeing are because:
1. `ui.js` doesn't exist - the build hasn't run successfully
2. The old `ui.html` file is still being referenced somehow
3. npm install/build is failing due to permission issues

## Solution

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

You need to install the dependencies. Since npm is having permission issues, try:

```bash
# Option 1: Install in the project directory
cd /Users/mschultz/FigmaTokensChecker/v1
npm install

# Option 2: If that fails, try with sudo (not recommended but may work)
sudo npm install

# Option 3: Use a different package manager
# If you have yarn:
yarn install

# Or if you have pnpm:
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Build the Project

Once dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm run build
```

This should:
1. Build the Tailwind CSS (`src/input.css` → `src/output.css`)
2. Build the plugin code (`src/main.ts` → `code.js`)
3. Build the UI (`src/ui.tsx` → `ui.js`)

### Step 3: Verify Output

After building, you should have:
- `code.js` (plugin code)
- `ui.js` (UI code)
- `src/output.css` (compiled CSS)
- `manifest.json` (auto-generated by build tool)

### Step 4: Remove Old Files (Optional)

Once the new build works, you can remove the old HTML file:
```bash
mv ui.html ui.html.backup
```

## Alternative: Use the Template Directory

If the build continues to fail, you could copy the working template structure:

```bash
# The template was created in preact-tailwindcss/
# You could copy your code there and build from that directory
```

## Troubleshooting

If `npm install` fails with permission errors:
1. Check npm permissions: `npm config get prefix`
2. Fix npm permissions: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm`
3. Or use a node version manager (nvm) to avoid permission issues

If the build fails:
- Make sure all dependencies in `package.json` are installed
- Check that `node_modules/@create-figma-plugin/build` exists
- Verify TypeScript can compile: `npx tsc --noEmit`
